How to build the Ptex Shaders

This project uses CMake.
Different applications use different compilers and support different platforms (32 Bits and 32 Bits).

This tutorial describes how to setup a 3dsMax plug-in project using CMake:
http://www.crackart.org/wiki/HowTo/CMakeForMax

For example, 3ds Max 2010 requires Visual Studio 2008, and can be compiled in 32 Bits and 64 Bits.

To build the plug-ins and shaders for 3ds Max 2010 for 32 Bits

Open CMake
Set the source code folder
Set the build folder using a last name:

Source : C:/SceneEngine/Git/PtexShaders/code
Build  : C:/SceneEngine/Git/PtexShaders/build_msvc90_32

msvc90 is Visual Studio 9.0 aka 2008
32 is 32 Bits

Configure and Generate.

Note:

For simplicity I copy all the MaxSDK and MayaSDK folders to a C:\Libraries folder:

For 3dsMax 2010...

C:\Libraries\maxsdk\12
C:\Libraries\maxsdk\12\mentalray

For 3dsMax 2011...

C:\Libraries\maxsdk\13
C:\Libraries\maxsdk\13\mentalray

There is a way to allow the user to set these folders in CMake.
